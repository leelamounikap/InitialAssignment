# InitialAssignment
Initial Assignment with asp.net core as web api and Angular as UI
Create an API in C# (or your most proficient language) that will sort a deck of cards.  The cards will be given to you in a random order, and you are to sort the cards two through ace within the suit and then the suits in diamond, spades, clubs, hearts order.
 
The cards are represented as a string in the following format
 
2d - two of diamonds
3d - three of diamonds
...
10d - ten of diamonds
Jd - jack of diamonds
Qd - queen of diamonds
Kd - king of diamonds
Ad - ace of diamonds
 
d - diamonds
s - spades
c - clubs
h - hearts
 
The cards will be given to you as a list of strings, e.g. in C# it would be List<String> cards = new List<String>(new string[] {"3c", "Js", "2d", "10h", "Kh", "8s", "Ac", "4h" })
 
In the end, the output of the sorted cards will be 2d, 8s, Js, 3c, Ac, 4h, 10h, Kh.

For taking the input, create a small Angular app which should consists of an input field for taking the cards input and a section to show the output. Design of the UI is up to you.
The sorted cards stack output should be obtained from the .NET API.

Put your code in the Github and host in Azure Cloud (free edition). 

After completing the above steps,
Share the cloud hosted url of the app.
Upload the complete solution (Angular & .Net), in your personal Github repository & share the url.
